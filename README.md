Here, I've provided a few steps for setting up the project.

2. **Run the Installer:**

- Open the downloaded file and follow the instructions in the installer.
- The installer will include npm automatically.

3. **Verify Installation:**

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following commands to check the versions of Node.js and npm:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setup the project

1. **Clone the Repository**
